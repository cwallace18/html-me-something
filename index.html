    <h2>Schenectady, NY</h2>
    <img src="file:///Users/carolinewallace/lc101/html-me-something/images/Schenectady.jpg" />
    <p>I was born and raised in Schenctady, NY which is 2.5 hours Northeast of NYC. With the Adirondack Mountains in the background I had many adventures with my cousins on their farm in Schoharie Valley. Two to four hours from most of the major cities on the East Coast meant that I was never bored on the weekends. I spent a wonderful 18 years there before setting off for my next adventure, college!</p>

    <h2>Ann Arbor, MI</h2>

    <p>My next stop was Ann Arbor, home of the Maize and Blue; the Michigan Wolverine's. The next few years were a whirlwind of classes, parties, tailgates, football games and traveling the world. It was the first time I truly felt like I was home.</p>
    
    <h2>Rome, Italy</h2>

    <p>I was fortunate enough to be able to travel on account of my major, Classical Archaeology. During the course of my studies at Michigan I traveled to Rome two summers in a row. Italy was a magical land full of rolling hills, docile people and as much pizza, pasta and wine as your belly could handle and then some. I spent a total of 6 weeks each summer doing backbreaking work in the middle of nowhere Italy surrounded by new friends and colleagues and I wouldn't change it for the world.</p>
    
    <h2>Jordan</h2>
    <img src="file:///Users/carolinewallace/lc101/html-me-something/images/Jordan.jpg" />
    <p>Jordan is the most beautiful country I have ever had the pleasure of traveling throughout. The city was beatufiul but the real gems were the quiet country towns where everyone worked together to keep each other safely nestled under their mud roofs. We spent hours and hours each day surveying the countryside with the locals and enjoying all of the culture and cuisine they so gractiously offered.</p>
    
    <h2>Jerusalem</h2>
    <img src="file:///Users/carolinewallace/lc101/html-me-something/images/Jerusalem.jpg" />
    <p>While working in Jordan I spent and amazing weekend in Jerusalem. My first night I slept on the roof of a 5,000 year old church. The next night was spent in a mudhut on a commune in the countryside. It was something else! History truly came alive with every turn down the narrow streets.</p>
